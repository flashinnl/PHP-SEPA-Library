# PHP-SEPA-Library

Creation of SEPA XML files according pain.008.001.02 in replacement of CLIEOP files.
Originally developed by MarcelGroot/PHP-SEPA-files.
Transforming this into a library that will fit our needs and maybe others.
First goal is transforming our CLIEOP03 environment into SEPA files as accepted by our bank: Rabobank.


## Overview

- sepaclass.php contains the classes for the generation of the XML file.
- MakeSEPAFile.php shows you how you can retrieve data from your database and use it to create the XML file.


## Changelog

- 15-12-2013 - Forked repo from MarcelGroot/PHP-SEPA-files and startup development
